# Voice-Tone-Analysis
Audio classification or sound classification can be referred to as the process of analyzing audio recordings. This amazing technique has multiple applications in the field of AI and data science such as chatbots, automated voice translators, virtual assistants, music genre identification, and text to speech applications. In this case we are classifying the given dataset consisting of 6500 speech files into the corresponding emotions portrayed and their levels. We will be implementing Audio classification by using the TensorFlow machine learning framework. We would be considering a raw audio dataset and categorize it based on the two 􏰜􏰕􏰟􏰆􏰜􏰏 􏰠􏰡􏰆􏰏􏰢􏰓 􏰕􏰑􏰖 􏰠􏰡􏰆􏰏􏰣􏰓. Followed by pre-processing, creating, and training a deep learning model to perform classification. We convert the audio signal from raw audio into two spectrograms before being fed into the models. A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength of a signal over time at various frequencies present in a particular waveform.
